Check out some of my projects <a href="#"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p> <p>My name is <strong>Soon Young Kwon</strong> (just <strong>Young</strong> is fine!), and Iâ€™m a <strong>Mechanical Engineering &amp; Materials Science</strong> student at <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Harvey Mudd College</strong></a> with a passion for <strong>robotics</strong>, <strong>automotives</strong>, <strong>consumable tech</strong>, <strong>human-centered design</strong>, and <strong>humanitarian technology</strong>.</p> <p>I see engineering as a bridge between theory and lived experienceâ€”a powerful tool for solving real problems and creating tangible change in our quality of life. Iâ€™m currently focused on applying my skills through <strong>research</strong>, <strong>hands-on projects</strong>, and <strong>internships</strong> that challenge me to think critically and design with purpose.</p> <hr> <h2 id="-skills--focus">ðŸ›  Skills &amp; Focus</h2> <p>I blend <strong>visual design</strong> with <strong>rigorous analysis</strong>, aiming to build systems and products that are not only functional but intuitive and elegant.</p> <ul> <li> <strong>CAD &amp; Modeling</strong>: SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Fusion 360, Blender â€” for mechanical assemblies, 3D rendering, and prototyping</li> <li> <strong>Simulation &amp; Analysis</strong>: ANSYS and MATLAB â€” for thermal, stress, and fluid simulations</li> <li> <strong>Programming</strong>: Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS â€” for front-end/back-end development, automation scripts, and machine learning</li> <li> <strong>Digital Fabrication</strong>: CNC milling, 3D printing (FDM/SLA), and composite layups â€” used in lab and personal projects</li> </ul> <hr> <p>When Iâ€™m not engineering, I love to listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0XrOqvxlqQI6bmdYHuIVnr" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Modern Wisdom</strong></a>, drink matcha with friends, and go for a swim (<a href="https://www.swimcloud.com/swimmer/1996834/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>SwimCloud</strong></a>)!</p> </body></html>
